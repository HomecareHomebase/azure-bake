## Changelogs
* [@azbake/ingredient-storage](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Overview

The Storage ingredient is a plugin for Bake.  When included in a recipe this will create a standard storage account. Whether services `blob`, `file`, `disk`, `queue`, or `table` storage are mounted on this resource is not defined in the template, only the logical construct is created.

## Usage

This typically would be included as a dependent resource in a recipe. It is possible to setup a **stand alone** instance, but would not be a typical inclusion.  Metrics and diagnostic logs are recorded to Storage Analytics is enabled by default.

## Uploading Files to Blob Storage

Files can be uploaded to a blob container during deployment by specifying the `source` property within the recipe. The source property supports pointing to a direct file via `file:///` syntax or pointing to a directory using relative pathing.

NOTE: only blob storage is supported at this time.

```yaml
name: My package
shortName: mypkg
version: 0.0.1
ingredients:
  - "@azbake/ingredient-storage@~0"
parallelRegions: false
resourceGroup: false
recipe:
  mypkg-storage:
    properties:
      type: "@azbake/ingredient-storage"
      source: "file:///./deploy/deploy.zip" # "./deploy"
      parameters:
        storageAccountName: "[storage.create_resource_name()]"
        container: myContainer
        uploadPath: mypkg/__build_buildNumber__
        deploy: false
        unzip: true
```
